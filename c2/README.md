# Challenge 2 - A Simple Terminal Interface
Applications start to get much more useful when you can make a commandline interface. So that's what we're doing!

We get the same data as before, but we're going to run our script like this:

`python3 main.py username`

Let's se what this might look like for Sophie Bennett:

`python main.py sbennett`

Output:

```
Sophie Bennett
  Username: sbennett
  Location: London, UK
```
