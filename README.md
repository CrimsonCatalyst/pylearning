# PyLearning
This project is going to be broken down into challenges (named c1, c2, etc.) Each challenge will have a folder named after the challenge. You will be tasked with writing a Python script that does what the challenge asks. To get started with the first challenge, you'll need to do the following:

- Download Python (not through a package manager). You need to download a compiled version of it. Go [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/source/) to download version 3.13.4. A gzipped version is fine.
- When you uncompress that version of Python, put it in your home folder. Referencing it will be annoying though, so why not add an alias to it in your `.bashrc`?
- Get your Python version from the commandline. You usually run `python3 --version`, but you'll replace `python3` with your alias.

## Challenges
Each challenge will be a little different. For each challenge, you'll create a `main.py` file and all the code for the challenge will be stored in there. Some challenges will come with a `main.py` file with some code in it. You'll pull the repository to get new challenges. Once you write a file that you think solves the challenge, you'll push your changes. Each challenge will contain a README file that explains what the challenge is.

After you've finished a challenge, I'll upload a new file in the challenge folder called `sm.py` that will be my solution to the given problem. There will be comments that explain why I did what I did and how it diverges from your solution.
