# Challenge 1 - Location Mapping
In this challenge, you will be given a list of users. The users will all have a location ID attached to them, but this is no good. These location IDs don't mean anything to us! Luckily we have a dictionary that maps location IDs to the actual name of the location. Your task will be to loop through the users and print out their name and location in the following format:

`name - location`

You won't always get what the correct output is, but this time you will get it. Here's what the output should look like (order doesn't matter):

```
Seongwoo Kim - Seoul, South Korea
Sophia Bennett - London, UK
Leo Fernandez - Buenos Aires, Argentina
Gabriel Santos - Rio de Janeiro, Brazil
Zhurong Chen - Shanghai, China
Maya Rodriguez - Toronto, Canada
Srithi Patel - Mumbai, India
```
